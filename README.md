# Barcode Generation in Google Sheets with HTML and CSS Export

This project demonstrates how to generate various barcodes within Google Sheets using formulas and the `SPARKLINE` function. The barcodes can be customized with different formats and options, and the data can be exported as HTML and CSS for integration into other projects.

## Features

- **Barcode Generation**: Create barcodes directly in Google Sheets using formulas.
- **No Code/Low Code**: Easily generate barcodes without extensive coding knowledge.
- **HTML and CSS Export**: Export Google Sheets data, including barcodes, as HTML and CSS for use in web projects.
- **Supported Barcode Formats**: Includes Code 39, Code 128, UPC-E, and more.

## Getting Started

1. **Google Sheets Setup**: 
   - Create a new Google Sheets document.
   - Add product names and ID numbers to columns A and B, respectively.
   - Use the following formulas in columns C and D to generate barcodes:

    | Product Name  | Product ID Number | Barcodes (Font: Libre Barcode 128) | Barcodes (Options) |
    |---------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------|
    | Socks, Black  | 748311             | =”*”&B3&”*”                        | =SPARKLINE(Code11(B3),BarcodeOpt()) |
    | Socks, White  | 748312             | =”*”&B4&”*”                        | =SPARKLINE(Code39(B4,TRUE),BarcodeOpt()) |
    | Socks, Red    | 748313             | =”*”&B5&”*”                        | =SPARKLINE(Code93("748313"),BarcodeOpt()) |
    | Socks, Blue   | 748314             | =”*”&B6&”*”                        | =SPARKLINE(upce(B6),BarcodeOpt()) |

2. **Barcode Font**: 
   - Install the [Libre Barcode 128](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Libre+Barcode+128) font in Google Sheets for proper barcode rendering.
   
3. **Exporting Data**:
   - Once your barcodes are generated, export the sheet as an HTML file:
     - Go to `File` > `Download` > `Web page (.html, zipped)`.
   - Extract the ZIP file to access the HTML and CSS files.

## Usage

- The exported HTML file can be integrated into web applications for displaying barcodes.
- The CSS file controls the appearance of the barcodes and can be customized further if needed.

## Notes

- Ensure that the formulas are correctly applied, and the fonts are installed to avoid errors in barcode generation.
- The `SPARKLINE` function with `BarcodeOpt()` allows additional customization of barcode appearance.

## Example Output

The `My-Barcodes.html` file contains an example of the output generated using the formulas and export method described. The table includes product names, ID numbers, and their corresponding barcodes in multiple formats.
